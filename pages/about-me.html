                    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Justin Pak, but my friends almost always call me "jpak." 
                        It's gotten to a point where my friends constantly forget what 
                        my real name is.</p>
                </div>
    
                <div id="abt-role">
                    <h3>What Do I Do?</h3>
                    <p>My title is "Senior Test Engineer." What that means is that I 
                        create automation scripts for my clients in order to test their 
                        product. I ensure that my client's software runs silky smooth for 
                        users to enjoy. Some other things I do are code tools to gather 
                        data for other testers and manually execute test cases.</p>

                <div id="abt-goals">
                    <h3>My Goals?</h3>
                    <p>Being a Test Engineer for 2+ years has been extremely educational 
                        and rewarding, but I think I am ready to delve into the development 
                        world. I've always had a knack for design, so I would love to pursue a 
                        Front-End or Full-Stack Development role. Creating user-friendly UIs 
                        and designing highly-functional systems is something that I was always 
                        interested in. So, I believe my future lies in Front-End or Full-Stack 
                        Development.</p>

                    <h3>Any Hobbies?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! I love taking street photos on my film camera over the weekends. 
                        I shoot with a Pentax K2, in case you were wondering. I've been playing 
                        bass guitar for around 4 months now, and I'm obsessed with it. I am still 
                        a beginner, but I dream of joining or starting a band one day. I play 
                        basketball, but not nearly as much as I used to. And of course, video 
                        games.</p>
